        <p><em>Associate associate Pastor of <strong><a href="https://web.facebook.com/GlobalFamilyJCRC">GFJCRC</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I am a pastor in an independent church which is a full gospel church. I love watching movie and series anime and also loving my significant other.</p>

        <p><strong>My life verse:</strong> <em>Jeremiah 33:3 'Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.'(NKJV)</em></p>
        <p><em>"The answer to our question in life is not WHAT but WHO. Who would answer all your questions? who would help you understand the situation?
            why WHO? because God is the only person that is with you and always with you and the only person who know everything about you.
            We creat our own answer but in the end we fail, I stand firm to what I believe that God and His word is the answer for you."</em> </p>
